### Pull Requests ###
Thanks for helping out!
- Bug patches/fixes are welcome and thanked.
- Actual feature implementations are better off post-communicative. Coordinating a feature implementation with myself prior to would benefit them the most.

### Code Format ###
At least give the below a shot.
- New style syntax is required and must be compatible with the latest **stable** build from SourceMod (currently 1.9).
- Local, non-static, non-array variables should be lowercase.
- Methodmap properties and global variables should have a single letter prefix indicated their type (fl for float).
- Opening braces should be given their own line.
- Functions and Methods should be in UpperCamelCase.
